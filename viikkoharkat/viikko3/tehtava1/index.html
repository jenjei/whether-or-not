    <h1>Hello World! My name is Jenni. Nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p>My dream is to become a coder someday. <br>I want creative job. 
        <br> I would like to develop some cool software or website/ webstore. <br>
        Social media and media in general play a big role nowadays. <br> I think I have visual eye for things, and most happily I'd like to call
        myself software designer. <br> I like that word: designer.
        <br><br>
        I am also interested in information security. <br> I love to solve problems and mysteries. 
        <br>When I was a child my dream was to be detective, I wanted to have adventures and make a world better place. <br> <em>Safer.</em> <br>
        I think I still have the same vision. <br>
        I never really thought I would find myself studying engineering, but this has been truly exciting and completely something new!
        <br><br>
        But anyhow, who knows what I'll end up doing...
